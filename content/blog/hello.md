It's been way more than a minute, long enough to wonder if I can still write a decent blog post. After all, a lot can change in nearly a decade. Still, I have been thinking about writing again, and a [blog post](https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/21/blockheads-r-us/) from Cory Doctorow finally helped me overcome my intertia. Cory says that “[Writing is a cognitive prosthesis for me. Working things out on the page helps me work things out in my life.](https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/21/blockheads-r-us/#:~:text=Writing%20is%20a%20cognitive%20prosthesis%20for%20me.%20Working%20things%20out%20on%20the%20page%20helps%20me%20work%20things%20out%20in%20my%20life.)” That’s close to how I feel. For me, it’s only when I can write about a topic that I have confidence that I understand it. And since I love trying to figure things out, I’m going to have to write. To me the most relatable sentence in Cory’s piece is “[[T]he _very act_ of writing is so important to me that even if no one read me, I would still write.](https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/21/blockheads-r-us/#:~:text=the%20very%20act%20of%20writing%20is%20so%20important%20to%20me%20that%20even%20if%20no%20one%20read%20me%2C%20I%20would%20still%20write.)”

So I’m going to start again. And if you, dear reader, find the articles interesting, I hope you’ll join me. At this point I can’t commit to a specific schedule, but I’m sure it won’t be frequent enough to feel like spam. On the other hand, I do have enough ideas in mind to establish some momentum. So check back when you can; see if you find something you like, and feel free to [let me know](mailto:stephen@sathomas.me) how I’m doing.
