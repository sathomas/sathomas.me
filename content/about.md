# A Quick Introduction

Writing about yourself feels awkward, but anyone who finds this site deserves to know something about its author. I’m not an AI bot, for example, though I guess you’ll have to trust me on that. More to the point, the content here draws from several fields, and you can reasonably wonder if I’m qualified to discuss all of them. If any particular post strains plausibility, then I’ve erred in my writing. Send me a polite [note](mailto:stephen@sathomas.me), and I’ll do my best to fix it. That said, my academic and professional background includes a fair bit of math, biology, and computers.

The math part started before my freshman year at college. I knew I was going to Georgia Tech which strongly suggested an engineering degree. But I had no clue about what engineers actually did and certainly no idea about which field of engineering might suit me. But there was no doubt about my love and aptitude for mathematics, so I simply asked folks which engineering discipline most relied on math. The consensus response was electrical engineering, and that’s how I ended up with a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

<span class="sidenote">Georgia Tech, like several schools at the time, promoted engineering as a peer of science rather than subordinate to it, so the College of Engineering did not award Bachelor of “Science” degrees.</span> degree. The attraction didn’t end there. Research for my Master’s degree relied heavily on queuing theory, and my Doctoral Thesis includes a heavy dose of non-linear differential equations.

It was, in fact, those PhD studies that introduced me to serious biology. My research focused on social behavior of bacteria, in particular advancing the theories behind its development and its effects on evolutionary fitness. And while I’m—at best—a very part-time biologist, I’ve had the opportunity to work and collaborate with some of the finest scientists in the world.

As for computers, let me say that my love/hate relationship goes _way back._ For my first software class, we typed our programs on key punches and handed the resulting decks of cards to the friendly computer operators who would run them overnight. I’ve since worked in software engineering at giant companies, three-person startups, and everything in-between. As of this writing, my full-time position is a software engineer at a leading international biotech organization.

If all that information isn’t boring enough, you can find additional links at the bottom of the page. Please feel free to follow up with me on any of those platforms.
